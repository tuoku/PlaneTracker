# PlaneTracker

An app for airplane identification & tracking utilizing augmented reality for identifying planes flying overhead.

How to use: 
First when you open the app you will see a worldmapview, and planes fying on there. When you press selected plane from the map you will see its details. Then we have a list of favourites ( You can add your own favourite planes(routes) there also.) And then we have an AR view, which is supposed to give you the details about certain plane.
